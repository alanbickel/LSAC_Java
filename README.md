# LSAC_Java
Secure Asynchronious Communication Log

A simple text-file based 'journal'. Multiple users may exist, each with their own password and unique encryption hash.
allows searching by date(filtering) or keyword, and supports seperate organization paths by topic or date.  
A little project that I wrote while taking an Intro to Java course, I wanted to learn alittle more about OOP, GUI development, and write a program that actually DOES something neat.... (I use it at work to keep my kitchen managers in the loop about potentially sensitive information :)

I'd love any feedback you have to offer!!!!
