Secure Asynchronious Communication Log

A simple text-file based 'journal'. Multiple users may exist, each with their own password and unique encryption hash.
allows searching by date(filtering) or keyword, and supports seperate organization paths by topic or date.  
A little project that I wrote while taking an Intro to Java course, I wanted to learn al ittle more about OOP, GUI development, and write a program that actually DOES something neat.... 

I'd love any feedback you have to offer - (be gentle, it's my first GitHub Repo)
